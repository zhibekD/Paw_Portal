# **PawPortal - The Pet Adoption and Shelter Management System**

This project focuses on pet adoption and shelter management, providing an efficient system for tracking adoptions, fostering, donations, and medical care for rescued animals. Shelters can register pets, schedule vet check-ups, manage adoption applications, and link donations to funding needs.
